# iPARK CONCEPT

Domain: ipark.hungthinhcloud.freeddns.org

Landing page: `LOGIN` page, where users can enter their username and password to login to the iPark web-application. After successful login, users will be redirected to the `HOME_DASHBOARDS` page.

## DEVELOPMENT & UI NOTE

- **Development Priority:** Functionality over aesthetics. The team will focus on getting the core logic and features to "work" first, and make it "look good" later.
- **Design Style:** The initial UI will follow a mock-up design featuring modern curve shapes. Any major aesthetic modifications or additions will be addressed in a later polishing phase.

## 0. LOGIN

A simple login page for users to login to the iPark web-application. Users need to enter their username and password to login. A valid username and password combination is required to login successfully.

*Alternative flow:*

- If the users `forget their password`, they can click the "Forgot Password" button to prompt a dialog to enter their registered `email`. *(no need to implement the actual email sending, just reset the password to a default value such as `Password@123` after the user enters their registered email and clicks the reset button)*
- If the users enter an `invalid username or password`, they will see a generic error message "Invalid username or password" and can try again. Max attempts is 5, after that the IP address of the user will be blocked for 30 minutes, and the user can not login from that IP address until it is unblocked automatically after 30 minutes or manually by an admin *(no need to be exactly 30 minutes, can be 1 minute for short demonstration)*. A security event will also be triggered and logged in the `EVENT_HISTORY_DB`.

## 1. HOME_DASHBOARDS

Home page of the iPark web-application, where users can view the dashboards that are assigned to them based on their permissions. Each dashboard can have multiple widgets that display different information about the parks, staffs, events, etc.

### 1.1. DASHBOARD

Dashboard is a collection of widgets that are displayed on the home page of the iPark web-application. Each dashboard can have multiple widgets that display different information about the parks, staffs, events, etc. The dashboards are assigned to users based on their permissions, and users can only view the dashboards that they have permission to view.

**Due to demonstration purpose**, creating completely custom widget is not supported, instead, users can only choose from a list of pre-configured widgets with specific data sources and parameters. Users can add/remove/rearrange/resize the widgets in the dashboard, but can not edit the content and functionality of the widgets. The pre-configured widgets are designed to cover the most common use cases and scenarios for park management, such as showing current slot usage, estimated income, staff working time, etc.

A dropdown menu to select the dashboard to view. The dashboard that is pinned will be loaded by default when the user logs in. Users can pin/unpin the dashboard to set it as the default dashboard to load when they log in.

Quick actions:

- **View**: view the dashboard with the widgets, pin/unpin. Requires `view_dashboard` permission
- **Edit**: edit toggle button to enter edit mode, in which the user can add/remove/rearrange/resize the widgets in the selected dashboard. Requires `edit_dashboard` permission
- **Pin/Unpin**: pin/unpin the dashboard to set it as the default dashboard to load when the user logs in. Requires `edit_dashboard` permission
- **Add**: add a new dashboard to the system. Requires `add_dashboard` permission
- **Delete**: delete the dashboard from the system. Requires `delete_dashboard` permission

### 1.2. WIDGET

Widget is a component that displays specific information or functionality on the dashboard. Each widget has a specific data source and parameters that determine what information it shows and how it shows it **however the `datasource` is not editable**.

### 5.1. NOTIFICATIONS SETTINGS

- **Enable/Disable notifications**: a switch on/off to enable or disable the notifications of the system.

## 7. DATABASE

*DEMONSTRATION DATABASES*: All databases are functional in the demo. Each table is backed by a live in-memory store, so add/edit/delete actions persist during the demo session. Seed data is loaded on startup, and UI mutations update the active store immediately.

*NOTE*: If `is_enable` is `false`, the respective status flag (`is_operating`, `is_on_shift`, or `is_online`) is `false` and can not be `true` until `is_enable` is `true`. Moreover, false `is_enable` means the entry is disabled and can not be assigned to other related database entries, but the entry can still be viewed and edited in the system. For example, if a park is disabled, the park can not be assigned to staff members and widgets, but the park can still be viewed and edited in the system.

*Datatype*:

- **pos_int**: positive integer >= 1, smaller than `integer` type in most programming languages, can not be empty

- **err_code**: string, the error code, formatted as `0xhhhh` where `h` is a hexadecimal digit (0-9, a-f), for no error, the error code is `0x0000`, can not be empty
- **string**: string, no longer than 256 characters, can be empty string `""`
- **list**: list of `string`, each string is separated by comma `,`, can be empty string `""` for empty list

- **object_name**: string, the name of an object, such as `group_name`, `park_name`, `staff_name`, etc., must be unique in the corresponding table, no longer than 256 characters, can not contain spaces and special characters except `_`
